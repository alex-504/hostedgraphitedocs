Primary Dashboards
==================
   
.. index:: Dashboards


Full-featured, interactive dashboards come standard with all Hosted Graphite `plans <https://www.hostedgraphite.com/signup/>`_!


To create a new dashboard, hover over the ``+`` icon on the left side-menu and select ``dashboard``.
You can `add new rows and panels <https://www.metricfire.com/blog/grafana-dashboards-from-basic-to-advanced/>`_ to the dashboard as shown below.

   </video>

From here you will add a metric to the graph by clicking on the title of the panel, selecting ``edit`` to open the graph editor, and clicking on the ``pencil icon`` in the query section. Then you can add your metrics to the graph, apply `Graphite functions <https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html>`_ on the metrics, modify the graph Visualization, Display, Axes, Legend, Thresholds, and Time Regions. Navigate to the ``settings gear`` in the top-right corner to assign variables to indexes in your metric series, add annotations, or import/export JSON models. 

Check out our full tutorial on `Connecting Graphite to Dashboards <https://www.metricfire.com/blog/graphite-and-grafana/>`_ to find out how to get metrics into the platform. We also have resources for people using `other data sources <https://www.metricfire.com/blog/grafana-data-sources/>`_.

To apply a `Graphite function <https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html>`_ to a group of metrics, open the graph editor, click the ``+`` icon and select the function to apply.

To zoom in on each graph you can highlight the section of a graph you wish to zoom in on or use the time range class="example-vids" preload="auto" controls on the top right. You can also set an auto-refresh rate to have your graphs update automatically. This is especially useful if you have a dedicated display for monitoring your graphs

   </video>

To organize your panels in rows, simply click on the ``add panel`` icon (an image of a bar-graph with a ``+`` on it, on the top right) and click on ``Convert to row``. You can move panels by simply dragging and dropping them around the dashboard. You can also click and drag the corners making it easy to adjust both height and width. See the different panels you can choose from and learn to build useful dashboards `here <https://www.metricfire.com/blog/our-favorite-grafana-dashboards/>`_.

To name save name your new dashboard, click on the ``floppy`` icon. To change the name of an existing dashboard, click the ``options`` cog on the top right and input the new name in ``Name`` then click ``save``. You can also add tags to your dashboards and create folders to help organize them.
