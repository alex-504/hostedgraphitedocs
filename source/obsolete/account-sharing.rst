Account Sharing
===============

For medium, large and magnum plans, we offer the ability to share your account using a login token.

A login token allows someone else full access to your account without having to know the password. The token expires after 5 minutes, so you can share it and not worry that someone will come across it later and compromise your account.

Security
----------------
It probably doesn't need to be said, but we'll mention it anyway - only share these tokens via a trusted medium, with people you can rely on. This token gives someone full access to your account, share it wisely!

Clicking the "Create Account Sharing URL" displays a URL to share. It's limited to 5 minutes, after which it will not work. As mentioned, this feature is available on the medium, large, and magnum plans.
