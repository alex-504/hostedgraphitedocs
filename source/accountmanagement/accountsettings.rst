Metric Expiry
-------------

.. index:: Metric Expiry, remove VM metrics, remove stale metrics, stale metrics

If you use a lot of transient metrics generated by spin-up VMs or on-demand instances, you may want to remove these after a period of time.

   Once you set an expiry limit, the system will automatically remove any metrics which haven't been updated since that time.

E.g. If you set the value to 7, any metric that hasn't been updated in 7 days will be removed. Prefixes can contain only alphanumeric and ``*``, ``.``, ``-``, ``_``, ``$``, ``%``, ``#``, ``=`` characters. Wildcard (``*`` character) is greedy, which means it will match everything which fits into the given pattern, as opposed to Graphite where it matches only one node level.

For prefixes that are subsets of each other, the more specific name will take priority. So for ``foo = 1`` and ``foo.bar = 5``, ``foo`` and ``foo.baz`` and ``foo.baz.steve`` will be set to 1. ``foo.bar``, ``foo.bar.baz`` and so on will be set to 5.  


Default Timezone
----------------

Setting a default timezone within Hosted Graphite ensures that graphs rendered by Graphite are configured to use that timezone.

After you fill out the form a confirmation link will be sent to your new email address to verify the change. 

If an account already exists with the new email, you'll need to either rename that one first or contact us to delete it.
